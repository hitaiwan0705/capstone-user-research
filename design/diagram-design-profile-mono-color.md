# Style Guide

**The single source of truth for colors, typography, and tokens.** Every diagram draws from this — not from hex values inlined in other reference files. If you want to change the visual skin of Diagram Design, change this file.

Default skin is a cool editorial palette — white-smoke paper, jet-black ink, atomic-tangerine accent, blue-slate muted. It's designed to look good out of the box; swap these values (or run [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md)) and every new diagram inherits the new skin without touching any type-specific logic.

To generate your own from a website URL, see [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md).

## Tokens

### Semantic roles

Every token is referred to by **semantic role**, not by its hex value. Type references (`type-*.md`) and SKILL.md say `accent`, not `#f7591f`.

| Role | Purpose | Default (light) | Default (dark) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paper` | Page background, default node fill | `#FAFAF7` (Neutral White substrate) | — (single light theme by choice) |
| `paper-2` | Diagram container bg, secondary fill | `#EDEDEA` (Charcoal 10% screen) | — |
| `ink` | Primary text, primary stroke | `#30343A` (Charcoal ink) | — |
| `muted` | Secondary text, default arrow stroke | `#5B5F65` (Charcoal screen, 6.14:1 on paper) | — |
| `soft` | Sublabels, boundary labels | `#5B5F65` (same as muted; keeps AA at 12px) | — |
| `rule` | Hairline borders | `rgba(48,52,58,0.14)` | — |
| `rule-solid` | Stronger borders, baselines | `#CDCECC` | — |
| `accent` | Focal / 1–2 max per diagram | `#C83232` (Signal Red ink, 5.07:1 on paper) | — |
| `accent-tint` | Fill for accent-bordered boxes | `#F6E4E1` (Signal Red 12% screen) | — |
| `link` | HTTP/API calls, external arrows | `#30343A` (no third ink; use dashed Charcoal) | — |

> **Brand palette source:** mono-color CIS, palette `palette_charcoal_signal_red` (chromatic + black) on `substrate_neutral_white`, from https://github.com/hitaiwan0705/mono-color-skill. Two printing inks only: every other value is a density screen of Charcoal or Signal Red. Do not use the series palette or a link-blue; encode extra categories with fill versus outline and solid versus dashed strokes.

> **Note:** The pre-baked example HTML files in `assets/` were built under an earlier skin. Regenerating them against the current `style-guide.md` is a v5.1 task. New diagrams the skill produces will use the tokens above.

### Inversion rule (light → dark)

Any `rgba(28,25,23, X)` in light becomes `rgba(250,247,242, X)` in dark. Same opacities, RGB flipped. The accent gets a slight hue-shift brighter to read on dark paper.

### Series palette (multi-series chart types only)

A small set of desaturated, editorial-tone colors for chart types that genuinely need to distinguish multiple overlapping entities (currently: **radar**). The "1-focal" rule still holds — `accent` is reserved for the focal series; the palette below covers the rest.

| Token | Light | Dark | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `series-1` | `#7c8f6f` (sage) | `#9caf8f` | Non-focal series |
| `series-2` | `#5e7a9b` (dusty-blue) | `#82a0c0` | Non-focal series |
| `series-3` | `#b8915a` (mustard) | `#d3ad7a` | Non-focal series |
| `series-4` | `#9c6b50` (rust-brown) | `#b88670` | Non-focal series |
| `series-5` | `#6e6479` (slate) | `#8d8298` | Non-focal series |

Fills sit at `0.18` opacity light, `0.22` dark; strokes use the full color. **Don't backfill these tokens to non-chart types** — architecture, swimlane, etc. continue to use muted-ink variants. The series palette is opt-in for diagrams where overlapping shapes demand distinguishable color, not a license to add color elsewhere.

### Terminal skin (opt-in alternate)

A self-contained palette for the terminal-window primitive (see [primitive-terminal.md](primitive-terminal.md)) — a CLI-chrome register for dev-tool posts and technical social cards. It does not replace the default skin above and isn't affected by onboarding; it's a second, fixed skin you opt into per-diagram.

| Token | Hex | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `terminal-page` | `#0a0a0a` | Page background behind the window |
| `terminal-paper` | `#141414` | Window body, node fill |
| `terminal-bar` | `#1b1b1b` | Titlebar strip |
| `terminal-border` | `#2b2b2b` | Window border, hairlines |
| `terminal-ink` | `#f5f5f5` | Primary text, primary stroke (same white-smoke as default `ink`) |
| `terminal-muted` | `#9a9a9a` | Secondary text, sublabels, ring stroke |
| `terminal-soft` | `#5c5c5c` | Tertiary — inactive dots, spokes |
| `terminal-accent` | `#ff5a36` | The one accent — focal station, prompt sign, active dot |
| `terminal-accent-tint` | `rgba(255,90,54,0.12)` | Fill for accent-bordered boxes |

**1-accent rule still holds.** Everything that isn't `terminal-ink` or `terminal-muted`/`terminal-soft` should be `terminal-accent` — never introduce a second hue.

## Typography

| Role | Family | Size | Weight | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | IBM Plex Sans + 思源黑體 Noto Sans CJK | 1.75rem | 700 | Page H1 |
| `node-name` | IBM Plex Sans + 思源黑體 Noto Sans CJK | 16px | 600 | Human-readable labels (CJK floor 12px) |
| `sublabel` | IBM Plex Sans + Noto Sans CJK | 12px | 400 | Secondary line inside a node |
| `eyebrow` | IBM Plex Mono | 12px | 500, tracked 0.12em, uppercase (Latin only) | Type tags, axis labels |
| `arrow-label` | IBM Plex Sans + Noto Sans CJK | 12px | 500, no tracking, 16px mask | Arrow annotations |
| `callout` | IBM Plex Sans + Noto Sans CJK | 16px | 500 | Editorial asides only |

### Font stack

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:wght@400;500;600&family=IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@400;500&family=Noto+Sans+TC:wght@400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Font stacks: sans `'IBM Plex Sans', 'Noto Sans CJK TC', 'Noto Sans TC', sans-serif`; mono `'IBM Plex Mono', monospace` (Latin technical strings only). Traditional Chinese labels follow the Korean-label rules below: 1em per full-width character, 12px floor, no uppercase or tracking, 16px-tall masks.

### Korean labels (reference; Traditional Chinese follows the same metrics with Noto Sans CJK TC)

Geist and Instrument Serif carry no Hangul. A Korean `<text>` element extends its own family — never swap the skin:

```svg
<text font-family="'Geist', 'Noto Sans KR', 'Apple SD Gothic Neo', 'Malgun Gothic', sans-serif">결제 서비스</text>
```

Both Noto faces ship in the font link above, so the web font resolves before any locally installed one and the same file renders identically on macOS, Windows, and a reviewer's browser. The local families follow it for offline viewing. Page titles need the serif equivalent — `'Instrument Serif', 'Noto Serif KR', serif` — or a mixed Latin/Korean title resolves Hangul through the platform's generic serif and the two halves disagree. Google's `css2` endpoint slices Korean by unicode-range, so a diagram with a handful of Korean labels downloads only the slices it touches. The four templates carry both faces because a new diagram may contain Hangul; the shipped Latin-only examples keep the shorter link, since a file with no Hangul has nothing to resolve.

**Width budget.** Measure per character, not per script: **every Unicode wide or full-width character costs 1em, every other character costs its face's Latin advance** (0.60em sans, 0.62em mono), and nonspacing/enclosing marks cost nothing. Sum over the string and multiply by the font size for the text width, then add padding and round the box up to the next multiple of 4. `verify-treemap.py` enforces exactly this text width for treemap cell labels; the padding and rounding are authoring convention, and no other type carries an automatic check, so on those the budget is yours to hold.

Counting by script is the trap. `주문 v2.1` is two full-width syllables and five narrow characters; a formula that tallies Hangul, Latin letters, and spaces silently drops `2`, `.`, and `1` and sizes the box for four of its seven characters. Every rendered character costs something — measure per character, never per script.

Three rules follow from Hangul metrics:

- **Sublabels stay Latin.** Ports, protocols, field types, and URLs are Latin anyway — keep `Geist Mono` there and don't translate them. Hangul in a 9px mono sublabel is unreadable and has no mono face to fall back to.
- **Floor of 12px.** Hangul goes muddy below 12px. If a Korean name doesn't fit at 12px, cut the name — don't shrink the type.
- **Arrow labels, eyebrows, and legend text switch register.** Those slots are 7–8px Geist Mono, uppercase and tracked, which Hangul has neither a face nor legibility for. A Korean label in one of those slots becomes 12px sans at weight 500 with no tracking and no uppercase transform, and its mask rect grows to match (16px tall, width from the budget above, still rounded to a multiple of 4). Latin labels in the same diagram keep the mono treatment.

**Load-bearing rule:** Mono (IBM Plex Mono) is for *technical* Latin content only. Names go in IBM Plex Sans + 思源黑體 Noto Sans CJK. Page title and annotation callouts also use IBM Plex Sans + Noto Sans CJK (this profile uses no serif for now; see the mono-color skill for when Noto Serif CJK is allowed) (see [primitive-annotation.md](primitive-annotation.md)). **Never JetBrains Mono** as a blanket "dev" font.

## Stroke, radius, spacing

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `stroke-thin` | `0.8` | Tag-box outlines, leaf nodes |
| `stroke-default` | `1` | Most strokes |
| `stroke-strong` | `1.2` | Emphasis strokes |
| `radius-sm` | `4` | Small tags |
| `radius-md` | `6` | Node boxes |
| `radius-lg` | `8` | Containers, rings |
| `grid` | `4` | Every coord, size, and gap is divisible by 4 (hard rule) |

---

## Node type → treatment

Semantic role combinations — reference these by name in type specs.

| Type | Fill | Stroke |
|---|---|---|
| `focal` (1–2 max) | `accent-tint` | `accent` |
| `backend` | `#ffffff` (white) | `ink` |
| `store` | `ink @ 0.05` | `muted` |
| `external` | `ink @ 0.03` | `ink @ 0.30` |
| `input` | `muted @ 0.10` | `soft` |
| `optional` | `ink @ 0.02` | `ink @ 0.20` dashed `4,3` |
| `security` | `accent @ 0.05` | `accent @ 0.50` dashed `4,4` |

## Customizing the skin

Four options:

1. **Run onboarding** — see [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md). Drop a URL; the skill extracts the palette + fonts and rewrites this file.
2. **Edit by hand** — change the hex values in the tables above. Run the pre-output taste gate afterward to verify the accent still reads as "focal" against the new paper color.
3. **Brand handoff** — paste your existing design-token JSON into a new section here and map its tokens to the semantic roles above.
4. **Client profiles** — save and switch named skins, or bind one to a project, using [`profiles.md`](profiles.md).

### Constraints (don't break these)

- **Contrast**: `ink` must hit WCAG AA on `paper`. `muted` must hit AA on `paper` for 11px+ text.
- **One accent**: pick one color for `accent`. Two accents erases the focal signal.
- **No rainbow palette**: if your brand ships 8 colors, pick 3 (paper, ink, accent). The rest become `muted` variants.
- **Serif + sans + mono**: three families, not more. This profile deliberately runs all-sans for now (user decision, 2026-09-24); the serif contrast is replaced by weight contrast (700 title vs 400 body) — the contrast is load-bearing.
- **Paper is warm-neutral, not pure white**: pure white turns the design sterile. Pick a cream, bone, or light grey with a hint of warmth.
- **Dot pattern is optional, not default**: the 22×22 dot pattern is an opt-in "dotted paper" variant (good for long-form editorial hero diagrams). The default background is a clean `paper` fill, no pattern. When the pattern is enabled, it should sit at ~10% opacity of `ink` on `paper` — visible but quiet.
- **Container is clean by default**: the diagram sits directly on the page paper, no secondary container background or border. A framed variant (`paper-2` bg + `rule` border + 8px radius + padding) is available as an opt-in for card-heavy layouts, but don't reach for it by default — the extra chrome fights the figure.
